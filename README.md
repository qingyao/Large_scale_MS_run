# Large scale workflow to process public MS data
 - LLM model based project filter
 - string alignment and clustering for file name grouping
 - download fastap based on taxID in metadata
 - generate manifest with file-group relation
    - run fragpipe
    - check results
    - edit manifest and iterate
 - for successfully processed files, re-name group label, match tissue/organ into ontology terms
 - convert the peptide intensity to whole-proteome ppm 
 - compute interaction score
 - book-keeping of filtered, processed, evaluated projects
